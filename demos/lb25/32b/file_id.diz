32-byte Intro for Atari 2600
Lovebyte 2025

by deater / dSr

Colored bars with some HMOVE sprite0
side-scrolling.

This code assumes the stack pointer
starts at $F9

If your stack pointer doesn't then
there will be some artifacts on
the screen (as seen in the lovebyte
screen capture, as my 2600+harmony
cart has the stack pointer elsewhere)
