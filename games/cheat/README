C.H.E.A.T.

an Atari 2600 Game

8k cartridge, needs NTSC

This was based on an old fake screenshot from the Homestar Runner people.
It was a parody of the opening screen of the infamous E.T game, but
with their character the Cheat instead.

I did the title, but then also came up with some E.T. inspired gameplay.

It's more of a demo, you really can't win.
