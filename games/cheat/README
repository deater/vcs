C.H.E.A.T.

an Atari 2600 Game

8k cartridge, needs NTSC


Directions
~~~~~~~~~~

Press reset/fire to start. Use the joystick to move.

You are the Cheat. Your goal is to collect 12 cheatcakes (little yellow boxes)
and take them to the Concession Stand.

Watch out! If the crude approximation of Strong Bad catches you, he'll
steal all your cheat cakes and send you back to your home.

While in a pit, watch out for grumble cakes (little black boxes) as
if you touch too many bad things can happen.

You can only carry 4 cheatcakes at a time

The fire button lets you float out of the pit

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

This was based on an old fake screenshot from the Homestar Runner people.
It was a parody of the opening screen of the infamous E.T game, but
with their character the Cheat instead.

I did the title, but then also came up with some vaguely E.T. inspired
gameplay.
