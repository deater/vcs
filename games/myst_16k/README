The story so far:

After finding a mysterious book with moving pictures inside, you
accidentally "link" yourself to an island full of secrets.

After solving multiple puzzles on a variety of worlds you
are nearing the exciting conclusion.

On your travels you had pieced together a note that said something
important will be revealed if you flip all of the marker switches up,
but the one on the dock down.

In the library are two books containing two brothers who seem
trapped.  One, who seems a bit greedy, implores you to gather
red pages and place them in his book.  One, who seems a bit
power hungry, implores you to gather blue pages and place them
in *his* book.

Be sure to check the library for other secrets.
