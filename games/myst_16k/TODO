Things to finish:
+ red/blue inside book overlay changes based on red/blue count
+ after winning: red/blue/white/pages so you can't get them anymore
+ after winning: erase brothers books
+ fix all glithces
+ fix pointer bounds on bottom of screen
   This is tricky because in book Y is *2 but on rest it is *4
+ door open, play different sound for when opening vs already open

Sound:
+ Fix linking book noise

Out there:
+ More locations?  Dentist chair, generator room?
+ Click on tower rotation makes noise
	Maybe even re-use clock sprites for rotating?




overlay patching:
	+ atrus
		patch white page to 0 if finished game
	+ behind_fireplace
		patch red or blue page if it's been taken
	+ red_book_close / blue_book_close
		patch page out if taken


TODO before release:
	+ books
		+ different message in book based on count


overlay proposal?

	Steal bit from bank/high.  Will have to add the $1000 manually to
		the address somewhere to free bits

	Have 48 byte alternate overlay included after the regular overlay.
		same colors
	Will it fit?

additional locations (reach goals):
	inside dentist
	inside generator
	inside cabin
	tall tree
	inside clock
	rocket in close
	tower rotation
	tower elevator
	tower top


allow picking up red/blue pages

modify red/blue books to have page plus ! symbol
for atrus book, have white page plus ! at first, then with ?

maybe alternate overlay, a reserved byte said which alternate overlay
	in a table to load in from ROM and use instead

copy overlay to RAM
	have way to load alternate overlay (for path opening, books)
