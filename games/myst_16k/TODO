Things to finish:

+ Add one more delay in the grab code
-> all for the page grab which takes 3 
-> either that or optimize drop page

+ remove aligns
-> I think last one is in clock_update

+ after winning: red/blue/white/pages so you can't get them anymore

+ fix bounds issues
-> atrus make page acceptance cover the page graphic too

+ fix graphics issues
-> winning screen right half is all zeros?

+ fix all glithces
-> pick up page in library, glitches

+ Clear atrus page question once game is finished
	This could be a barrier issue

+ Put notes/disclaimer in the 256 bytes of "empty" ROM.
	Hope this won't confuse emulators


Sound:
+ Fix linking book noise

Out there:
+ More locations?  Dentist chair, generator room?
+ Tower rotation?
	Maybe even re-use clock sprites for rotating?

	



overlay patching:
	+ atrus
		patch white page to 0 if finished game
	+ behind_fireplace
		patch red or blue page if it's been taken
	+ red_book_close / blue_book_close
		patch page out if taken


TODO before release:
	+ books
		+ different message in book based on count


overlay proposal?

	Steal bit from bank/high.  Will have to add the $1000 manually to
		the address somewhere to free bits

	Have 48 byte alternate overlay included after the regular overlay.
		same colors
	Will it fit?

additional locations (reach goals):
	inside dentist
	inside generator
	inside cabin
	tall tree
	inside clock
	rocket in close
	tower rotation
	tower elevator
	tower top


allow picking up red/blue pages

modify red/blue books to have page plus ! symbol
for atrus book, have white page plus ! at first, then with ?

maybe alternate overlay, a reserved byte said which alternate overlay
	in a table to load in from ROM and use instead

copy overlay to RAM
	have way to load alternate overlay (for path opening, books)
