After winning:
+ Move red/white/pages so you can't get them anymore
+ Erase brothers books


Fix all glitches:
+ Rocket close
+ Leaving fireplace
+ Entering clock_close

Fix Pointer Bounds:
+ At edges?
+ Bottom of screen.  This is tricky because in book Y is *2
	but on rest it is *4

Sound:
+ Fix linking book noise

Out there:
+ More locations?  Dentist chair, generator room?
+ Click on tower rotation makes noise
	Maybe even re-use clock sprites for rotating?




overlay patching:
	+ atrus
		patch white page to 0 if finished game
	+ behind_fireplace
		patch red or blue page if it's been taken
	+ red_book_close / blue_book_close
		patch page out if taken


TODO before release:
	+ books
		+ grabbable red/blue pages
		+ different message in book based on count
		+ bad endings
	+ after-win scenario
		+ brother books destroyed?





overlay proposal?

	Steal bit from bank/high.  Will have to add the $1000 manually to
		the address somewhere to free bits

	Have 48 byte alternate overlay included after the regular overlay.
		same colors
	Will it fit?

additional locations (reach goals):
	inside dentist
	inside generator
	inside cabin
	tall tree
	inside clock
	rocket in close
	tower rotation
	tower elevator
	tower top


allow picking up red/blue pages

modify red/blue books to have page plus ! symbol
for atrus book, have white page plus ! at first, then with ?


combine the library locations somehow
	a lot of overlap
maybe alternate overlay, a reserved byte said which alternate overlay
	in a table to load in from ROM and use instead

copy overlay to RAM
	have way to load alternate overlay (for path opening, books)
	

End, if room:
	Have all three pages.  Change hand color to match (Even though
		messes up the tree)
	Have book be configurable, edge be red/blue/green as appropriate.
	brother/atrus overlay?  decompress to 256 byte RAM?

	glitch out if you give wronge page?
	Atrus screen have picture of page and question mark?
