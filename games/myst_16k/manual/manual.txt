A VMW Production
by Vince `deater` Weaver, 2023

Prolog:
	A desperate man fleeing a dangerous situation falls
	in a starry void.  He escapes by touching a magical
	"linking" book that transports him away.  The book
	continues falling and the man worries who might find it.

Story:
	You are the one who found the book!  Throwing caution
	to the wind you touch the book and end up on Myst island.

	On the island two brothers appear trapped inside books
	of their own.  They are a bit evasive about how they
	ended up in this situation.  The somewhat conniving
	brother asks you to find red pages and put then in his book.
	The somewhat unstable brother begs you to find blue pages
	and put them in *his* book.

	You solve puzzles and travel to four different fantastic worlds
	(unfortunately not on this cartridge due to size limitations).
	You bring back red and blue pages and put them in the brothers books.
	They both want to be freed.  Who do you trust?

	You also found a torn note while exploring that when put together
	says:

         MARKER SWIT  |  CH VAULT ACCESS
                    |
	       ISL  |  AND OF MYST

   THE VAULT IS LOC  |  ATED IN VERY PLAIN VIEW ON
     THE ISLAND OF M  |  YST AND ACCESS CAN BE
      ACHIEVED VERY  |  EASILY IF THE SIMPLE
 INSTRUCTIONS ARE  |  FOLLOWED.  FIRST, LOCATE
EACH OF THE MARKER  |  SWITCHES ON THE ISLAND.
 TURN EVERY ONE OF T  |  HESE SWITCHES TO THE
"ON" POSITION.  TH  |  EN GO TO THE DOCK AND,
AS A FINAL STEP, TU  |  RN THE MARKER SWITCH
      THERE TO TH  |  E "OFF" POSITION.

	This should be enough to finish your adventure!

Use the joystick to move the pointer.
The pointer will change to indicate if you can move forward, left, right, or
	if an action is available.
Click the button to move or do an action.

If you appear stuck, carefully investigate the screen to see if there
are action areas you are missing.

Good Luck!
