Working on plan to put this on a real E7 cartridge.
Sacrificing a burgertime cart

Bought a bunch.  Singapore is epoxy blob, but made in US
	has through-hole DIP

Of the number I got, only one totally working of DIP type.
	Possibly known they go bad?

Board has E7 mapper, two ROMs (one 8k, one 4k) and
	TMM2009P-25A which is really hard to find, but probably
	1K SRAM (vaguely pin comaptible with 6116)
	But the -A means 1k with the A10 line always high?
	Investigating
