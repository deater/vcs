Working on plan to put this on a real E7 cartridge.
Sacrificing a burgertime cart

Bought a bunch.  Singapore is epoxy blob, but made in US
	has through-hole DIP

Of the number I got, only one totally working of DIP type.
	Possibly known they go bad?

Board has E7 mapper, two ROMs (one 8k, one 4k) and
	TMM2009P-25A which is really hard to find, but probably
	1K SRAM (vaguely pin comaptible with 6116)
	But the -A means 1k with the A10 line always high?
	Investigating

Using TL866 to dump roms
	linux minipro tool

	minipro -y -p "2732A @DIP24"  -r 4k_dump.rom

Compare ROMs:
	the 4k rom matches!

Added complication:
	the pinout for the 8k ROMs is the MCM68766 format
	however as far as I can tell this is a somewhat obscure
	non-standard format (24-pin DIP for 8k) and though it is found
	in old machines, like the IBM 5150, you need an adapter to
	a 27C64 DIP28 if you want to read/write to it with regular
	equipment.

	They do sell adapters so I guess I'll try that, though I am worried
	a bit about clearance issues



.  The minipro can't read it
