FIXME:
	glitches in "secret collect animation" on harmony cart
	also glitches but more mildly on sound effects, start of level

	stella fine, javatari fine...


Optimization:
	$0FF0 = end of ROM data (two levels)
v1.0:
	$0EBC = optimize "game over" code a lot.  lost a column
		of the duck animation but probably worth it
v1.3:
	Ran out of room, code ends at 0x8fe
	common vblank -> 0x8e2



clever coding:
	needed to only update X every 4 scanlines.  Also needed to shave
	off two cycles.  Ended up with this code that branches into
	the middle of an instruction to get the proper timing:

	iny                                                             ; 2
	tya                                                             ; 2
	and     #$3                                                     ; 2
	beq     yes_inx                                                 ; 2/3
	.byte   $A5     ; begin of LDA ZP                               ; 3
yes_inx:
	inx             ; $E8 should be harmless to load                ; 2
								;============
								; 11 cycles
