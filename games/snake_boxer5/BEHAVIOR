Snake Behavior.
This is based on the Java port
https://github.com/daniel-tran/snake-boxer-collection/

When snake levels up:
	xspeed+=.1
	attack-multiplier+=.1
	damageMultipler*=.9
	chance_of_action_after_hurt+=.1
	chance_change_direction=0.5
	chance_block=0.4
	chance_attack=0.75
	chance_action_after_hurt=0.5
	
	returning to idle
		50% chance of switching direction
		if was_hurt,	brief invincibility to avoid stuck by hits
	have a countdown (random) until switch direction?
		when hits, pick random#, compare to chance_change_direction
		to see if should or not
	
	action time
		countdown next action timer
		random.  attack/block/idle
			so above defaults,
				if random()<0.75, attack
				else if <0.40, block.  this makes no sense

	initial startup
		behavior useranadombehavior=0
		actionafterhurt=0
		default behavior=2
			claims real game behavior not change with time		

	three behavior types:
		0.  full random
			direction/block/attack all random
			hit after hurt =0.5
		1.  mostly attack
			chnagedir=0.75
			attack=1.0
			block=0.1
		2. mostly block
			changedir=0.25
			changeblock=0.8
			chanceattack=0.1
		default:
			


Collision detect


        snake_X:     snake_X+16
              SSSSSS

boxer_X:                      boxer_X+32
	XXXXX            XXXXX


	; minkowski sum collision?

	if (snake_X+8 <boxer_X-8) no collision?
		same as snake_x < boxer_X-16

                       83       84    100     101
	boxer: 100     91,92  92,92   108,92

	if (snake_X > boxer_X+40) no collision

punch hit:
	if (boxer_x


SFX:
	+ SFX_SNAKE_MISS:	snake lunge and miss (whip-crack)
	+ SFX_SNAKE_HIT:	snake lunge and hit (b-blank)
	+ SFX_PUNCH_MISS:	punch and miss (whiff)
	+ SFX_PUNCH_HIT:	punch and hit (blip)
	+ SFX_SNAKE_KO:		KO snake (da-oodle-der)
	+ SFX_BELL:		restart after KO (bell-bell)
	+ SFX_GAMEOVER: game-over (long rumble)

Snake:
	+ KO happens when bar hits zero, not after
	+ bars go down at end of animation

	+ when KO's, blinks 10 times
		blinks the injured sprite
		reset both to middle of screen

	+ moves back/forth?
		speed varies with level?
	+ color varies with level as well.  Seems to go
		0 d. green	8. blue-grey	16 grey
		1 cyan green	9. d. blue	17 white
		2 light blue	10. d green	18 lavender
		3 red		11. l green	19 purple
		4 orange	12 cyan		20+ black
		5 purplish	13 red
		6 yellow	14 purple
		7 m. blue	15 maroon
	+ 

Boxer:
	3 lives, you die when hit 0 (no blocks) not -1	

	when blocking, cannot punch or move
	when punching, cannot move

	when lose life, start as injured, then move to
		normal while blinking
	reset to middle of screen

	when lose last life, as above but then move to grave image

	ko happens when bar hits 0, not -1
	bars go down at end of animation
