End, if room:
	Have all three pages.  Change hand color to match (Even though
		messes up the tree)
	Have book be configurable, edge be red/blue/green as appropriate.
	brother/atrus overlay?  decompress to 256 byte RAM?

	glitch out if you give wronge page?
	Atrus screen have picture of page and question mark?


Only display right/left if can go that way

Intro: call into common routines instead of incuding them

Title:

Cleft:
	The book sprite could use more work on size
	Fix the stars

Book:
	adjust top left of page to not be uneven
	better sprite animation of destination
	better linking noise
	pause when in the process of linking, maybe black screen
	make generic so can use for other books?

level_engine:
	fix cycle count
	add code for mid-screen BG change?
	add GRAB code

Levels:
	adapt to shared engine

Marker switches:
	have code to show flipped switches.  In theory overlay is in
		RAM so this should be fairly straightfoward
		to modify at load/click
