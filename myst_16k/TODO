Title:

Cleft:
	The book sprite could use more work on size
	Fix the stars

Book:
	adjust top left of page to not be uneven
	better sprite animation of destination
	better linking noise
	pause when in the process of linking, maybe black screen
	make generic so can use for other books?

Levels:
	adapt to shared engine

Marker switches:
	have code to show flipped switches.  In theory overlay is in
		RAM so this should be fairly straightfoward
		to modify at load/click
