clever coding:
	needed to only update X every 4 scanlines.  Also needed to shave
	off two cycles.  Ended up with this code that branches into
	the middle of an instruction to get the proper timing:

	iny                                                             ; 2
	tya                                                             ; 2
	and     #$3                                                     ; 2
	beq     yes_inx                                                 ; 2/3
	.byte   $A5     ; begin of LDA ZP                               ; 3
yes_inx:
	inx             ; $E8 should be harmless to load                ; 2
								;============
