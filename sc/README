DIRECTIONS:
~~~~~~~~~~~

	You are Strong Bad (the Red Box)

	You need to collect the secret (the Yellow Box)

	Avoid the pulsing blue walls, which will zap you
		and reset your position and speed

	You need to collect the secret before time runs out

	A speed booster (a Blue Box) will make you go faster

	Collect as many secrets as you can before the duck gets you!
