DIRECTIONS:
~~~~~~~~~~~

	You are Strongbad (the Red Box)

	You need to collect the secret (the Yellow Box)

	Avoid the pulsing blue walls, which will zap you

	You need to collect the secret before time runs out

	A small puslsing blue pixel will make you go faster (TODO)

	Collect as many secrets as you can before the duck gets you!
