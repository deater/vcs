TITLE SCREEN:
	+ show red/yellow box animation?

LEVEL ENGINE:
	+ SCORE: update six digits? (currently 4)
		In theory not possible to score that high...
	+ lose points if hit wall?
	+ go to title screen if reset pressed
	+ slow down default speed
	+ fix all the timing glitches, mostly with sound
	+ make sure zap detection works at the edges
	+ speed reset after blue, not timeout
